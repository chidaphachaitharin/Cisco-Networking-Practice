# Cisco-Networking-Practice

This repository contains a collection of practice labs and configuration examples for Cisco networking devices. It includes various configurations for different Cisco technologies such as routing, switching, and security.

You can use these configurations in your own virtual labs (e.g., using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **GNS3**, or **Cisco VIRL**).

## Password Configuration

In these configurations, I have set the following passwords on Cisco devices for both **console** and **enable** access.

### Console Password:
- **Console password**: `cisco123`

### Enable Password:
Router> enable
- **Password: `class`
